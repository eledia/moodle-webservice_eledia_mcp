# Changelog

All notable changes to the **webservice_elediamcp** plugin are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- Fatal parse error in `classes/local/server.php` (`$this->wsname` assignment) that
  prevented the server class from loading at all.
- Upgrade savepoint in `db/upgrade.php` used the wrong plugin name (`mcp` instead
  of `elediamcp`), which would have broken the upgrade path on existing sites.
- Capability language strings (`elediamcp:use`, `elediamcp:viewcaps`,
  `elediamcp:managetokens`) were keyed under the pre-rename `mcp:*` names and did
  not resolve in the role-definition UI.
- Stale unit-test assertion pinning the advertised server version to `0.5.0`.

### Changed
- Advertised MCP `serverInfo.version` aligned with the plugin release (`0.8.0`).
- Relocated the convenience HTTP client from `lib.php` to the autoloaded class
  `\webservice_elediamcp\client`, so `lib.php` now contains only Moodle callbacks.
- `lib.php` now declares the `MOODLE_INTERNAL` guard.

### Added
- Self-service token page now renders a ready-to-paste **Claude Desktop**
  (`mcp-remote`) configuration snippet, with the freshly created token pre-filled
  once at creation time and a generic placeholder example for existing tokens.
- GitLab CI/CD pipeline (`.gitlab-ci.yml`): PHPCS (Moodle standard), PHPStan,
  Semgrep, Trivy, PHPUnit (with plugin-only coverage), Behat, PHPDepend metrics
  and a consolidated summary report.
- Repository governance files: `CHANGELOG.md`, `LICENSE`, `SECURITY.md`,
  `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `.gitignore`.

## [0.8.0]

### Added
- Self-service token management UI (create / view metadata / revoke) and an
  internal PHP API (`\webservice_elediamcp\api`) for first-party plugins to
  provision and revoke user-scoped tokens, with component attribution.
- Companion `webservice_elediamcp_token` metadata table that survives revocation
  for a durable audit trail; full Privacy API provider.
- Curated AI-native tool catalogue (`moodle_me`, `moodle_verify_user_context`,
  `moodle_find_user`, `moodle_my_courses`, `moodle_search_courses`,
  `moodle_course_contents`, `moodle_get_resource`, `moodle_get_announcements`,
  `moodle_calendar_upcoming`, `moodle_my_assignments`, `moodle_my_grades`,
  `moodle_send_message`).
- Multi-version MCP protocol negotiation (`2025-11-25`, `2025-06-18`,
  `2025-03-26`), tool annotations, structured output, `tools/list` pagination.
- Security controls: Origin/CORS allow-list, per-token/per-IP rate limiting,
  request-size limits, emergency disable, optional (off-by-default) query-string
  token, audit events.
- OAuth Protected Resource discovery (`/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource`)
  and `WWW-Authenticate` hints on 401.
